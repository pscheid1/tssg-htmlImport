# tssg-htmlImport

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home page is accessed via index.html

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific pages may be directly called by adding a hash value to the URL :
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\#name where page name is one of the following :
            - web-group
            - mobile-group
            - quality-group
            - data-group
            - devops-group

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example: domaine name/index.html#web-group

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The URL is updated automatically as pages are selected by icon or menu selection.  The link may be copied and saved off for direct access at a later time.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two debugging aids built into the code. By default, they are commented out of the code. There are comments in the code (tssgPageTemplate.html) that explain their use and how to enable/disable them.  The comments and code appear in the current version in lines 42 through 58.  When enabled, two menu items (Toggle-phone and Debug) appear at the extreme right end of the nav bar.
